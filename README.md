I have undertaken an initiative to learn machine learning algorithms, specifically deep learning. This involves working on a set of projects that utilize data collected by tracking the practices I aim to follow regularly. The underlying logic behind this initiative is that by working on projects using my own personal data, I believe it will motivate me to maintain consistency and build the momentum needed to master AI for solving real-world problems.

1. Food Image Classification
   
   I have implemented a binary image classifier using a convolutional neural network 
   that takes food images as input and outputs the corresponding food class.
   The dataset used is locally generated by capturing images of the food I intake 
   daily, which makes it particularly interesting.
