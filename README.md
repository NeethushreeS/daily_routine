I have undertaken an initiative to learn machine learning algorithms, specifically deep learning. This involves working on a set of projects that utilize data collected by tracking the practices I aim to follow regularly. The underlying logic behind this initiative is that by working on projects using my own personal data, I believe it will motivate me to maintain consistency and build the momentum needed to master AI for solving real-world problems.
